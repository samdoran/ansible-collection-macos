# README FIRST
# 1. If you don't have unit tests, remove that section.
# 2. If your collection depends on other collections ensure they are installed,
#    add them to the "test-deps" input.
# 3. For the comprehensive list of the inputs supported by the
#    ansible-community/ansible-test-gh-action GitHub Action, see
#    https://github.com/marketplace/actions/ansible-test.
# 4. If you want to prevent merging PRs that do not pass all tests,
#    make sure to add the "check" job to your repository branch
#    protection once this workflow is added.
#    It is also possible to tweak which jobs are allowed to fail. See
#    https://github.com/marketplace/actions/alls-green#gotchas for more detail.
# 5. If you need help please ask in #ansible-community on the Libera.chat IRC
#    network.
